Iâ€™m excited to announce that I am starting a *research assistant* under the guidance of *Prof. Danna Gurari* in the *Image and Video Computing Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder*! 

This incredible opportunity will allow me to work on cutting-edge research in the domain of **Knowledge Distillation** for Model Compression in **Computer Vision**, focusing on creating efficient and scalable AI models while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
