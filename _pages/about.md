Hello! I’m a Master’s student in **Computer Science** (Research Track) at the **University of Colorado Boulder**, with a 4.0 GPA. My work focuses on pushing the boundaries of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Generative AI**.

Currently, I’m working under <a href='https://dannagurari.colorado.edu/'> <b>Prof. Danna Gurari</b></a> at the Image and Video Computing Lab on **Knowledge Distillation for Model Compression**. This project aims to develop efficient AI models that preserve accuracy while significantly reducing computational demands, contributing to cutting-edge advancements in AI optimization. This work has been submitted to **CVPR 2025**.

Previously, as a **Data Scientist** with **3 years exp.** at HighRadius Technologies, I:

1. Built and deployed **AI-driven solutions** that enhanced financial workflows for Fortune 500 clients, reducing response times by 40% and boosting dollar recovery rates by 12%.
2. Led end-to-end **NLP projects** like Smart Email Composer, leveraging **Generative AI** for tailored responses.
3. Designed models for predictive analytics that cut operational inefficiencies by 30%.

I have hands-on expertise with tools and platforms like Python ,PyTorch, SQL, Hugging Face, GCP, AWS, and Azure.

I am passionate about applying cutting-edge AI to solve real-world problems and thrive in collaborative environments. Actively seeking **full-time opportunities starting May 2025**, I aim to contribute my expertise in **AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning** to impactful projects.

Let’s connect to explore how we can create innovative solutions together!
