#### Industry & Research Experience

I specialize in **LLM fine-tuning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Agentic AI**, **knowledge distillation**, and **on-device audio ML**, combining practical development expertise with research-oriented rigor.

- Currently working as an **AI/ML Applied Scientist** at **NeuroSpring**, where I build on-device deep learning models for speech abnormality detection using **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face**. I also developed an **Agentic RAG chatbot** that enables physicians to query patient PDFs with grounded responses, reducing clinical triage time by **60%**.

- As a **Graduate AI/ML Engineer** at the **Image and Video Computing Lab, University of Colorado Boulder**, I fine-tuned vision models and developed a novel **knowledge distillation** technique for computer vision. This layer selection strategy achieved **80% training efficiency** and **15% accuracy gain over SOTA** models, and was submitted to **NeurIPS 2025**.

- As an **NLP Research Associate**, I contributed to **SemEval 2023 Task 3** by fine-tuning multilingual BERT models for news genre classification using PyTorch and Hugging Face, tackling challenges in multi-label and cross-lingual NLP.

- Previously, spent 3.5+ years as a **Lead AI/ML Engineer** at **HighRadius Technologies**, where I built and deployed ML pipelines for Fortune 500 clients like **NestlÃ©**, **Uber**, and **Kraft Heinz**. I implemented a **GenAI-powered Smart Email Composer**, improved deduction recovery by **12%**, reduced **DSO by 30%**, and led a team of 10 across 15+ production ML projects and mentored over 50 interns in Data Science projects.

#### Technical Interests & Expertise

##### Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Fine-tuned and evaluated **Transformer-based models** like **LLaMA**, **GPT**, and **BERT** using **LoRA**, **QLoRA**, **PEFT**, and **instruction tuning**.  
- Applied **prompt engineering** and **task-specific adapters** to optimize performance in constrained compute settings.

##### Generative AI & Agentic Systems

- Built **RAG pipelines** and **agentic chatbots** using **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and **OpenAI APIs**.  
- Integrated **document-grounded reasoning** and **tool-calling** to enable auditable, context-aware LLM interactions.

##### Machine Learning & Audio/Computer Vision

- Designed **classification**, **regression**, and **sequence models** for financial forecasting and medical applications.  
- Engineered **audio signal processing pipelines** and developed **knowledge distillation** strategies for model compression and efficiency.

##### MLOps & Scalable Deployment

- Deployed models using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Vertex AI** across **GCP**, **Azure**, and **AWS**.  
- Built **CI/CD pipelines** and **reproducible workflows** using **MLflow**, **Weights & Biases**, and cloud-native orchestration tools.

I enjoy building systems that make unstructured data usable, interpretable, and impactful.

#### Education

I hold a **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science (Research Track)** from the **University of Colorado Boulder**.

---

#### Actively Seeking

I am actively pursuing **full-time opportunities** in **AI/ML**, **NLP**, or **GenAI** roles. With experience in both research labs and enterprise environments, Iâ€™m excited to bring my expertise in production-grade AI systems.
