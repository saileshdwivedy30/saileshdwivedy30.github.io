Hello! Iâ€™m **Sailesh Dwivedy**, an AI/ML Engineer with 5+ years of experience developing, deploying, and scaling production-ready solutions in **Generative AI**, **LLM fine-tuning**, **RAG**, **Agentic AI**, **audio ML**, **NLP**, and **Machine Learning**. I bring a unique blend of research-backed innovation and industry execution, having built and shipped AI systems across healthcare, finance, and academic domains for Fortune 500 clients.

### Industry & Research Experience

I specialize in **LLM fine-tuning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Agentic AI**, **knowledge distillation**, and **on-device audio ML**, combining practical development expertise with research-oriented rigor.

Currently, I work as an **AI/ML Applied Scientist at NeuroSpring**, where I build on-device AI deep learning model for speech abnormality detection using PyTorch and Hugging Face. I also developed an **Agentic RAG chatbot** that enables physicians to query patient PDFs through a chat interface, delivering GPT-4-generated answers grounded to sentence-level document evidenceâ€”reducing clinical triage time by **60%**.

Previously, I was a **Graduate AI/ML Engineer** at the **Image and Video Computing Lab, University of Colorado Boulder**, where I developed novel **knowledge distillation** techniques for computer vision. Our layer selection strategy achieved **80% training efficiency** and **15% accuracy gain over SOTA** models and was submitted to **NeurIPS 2025**.

I also contributed to **SemEval 2023 Task 3** as an **NLP Research Associate**, where I fine-tuned multilingual BERT models for news genre classification using PyTorch and Hugging Face, tackling challenges in multi-label and cross-lingual NLP.

Prior to that, I spent 3.5 years as a **Lead AI/ML Engineer at HighRadius Technologies**, building end-to-end ML systems for global Fortune 500 clients including **NestlÃ©, Uber, Clorox**, and **Kraft Heinz**. I deployed a **GenAI-powered Smart Email Composer**, improved deduction recovery by **12%**, and reduced **DSO by 30%** using predictive modeling. I also led a team of 10 engineers across 15+ production ML projects and mentored over 50 interns.

### Technical Interests & Expertise

#### Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Fine-tuned and evaluated **Transformer-based models** like **LLaMA**, **GPT**, and **BERT** using **LoRA**, **QLoRA**, **PEFT**, and **instruction tuning**.  
- Applied **prompt engineering** and **task-specific adapters** to optimize performance in constrained compute settings.

#### Generative AI & Agentic Systems

- Built **RAG pipelines** and **agentic chatbots** using **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and **OpenAI APIs**.  
- Integrated **document-grounded reasoning** and **tool-calling** to enable auditable, context-aware LLM interactions.

#### Machine Learning & Audio/Computer Vision

- Designed **classification**, **regression**, and **sequence models** for financial forecasting and medical applications.  
- Engineered **audio signal processing pipelines** and developed **knowledge distillation** strategies for model compression and efficiency.

#### MLOps & Scalable Deployment

- Deployed models using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Vertex AI** across **GCP**, **Azure**, and **AWS**.  
- Built **CI/CD pipelines** and **reproducible workflows** using **MLflow**, **Weights & Biases**, and cloud-native orchestration tools.

I enjoy building systems that make unstructured data usable, interpretable, and impactful.
