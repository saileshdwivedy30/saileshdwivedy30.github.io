## 📘 **Covered Modules**


1. **Introduction to Agents**  
   Fundamentals of AI Agents: reasoning and planning, the role of LLMs as the agent “brain,” and message-based structuring of conversations. Built the first agent, **Alfred**, using `smolagents`, applying the Think → Act → Observe workflow.

2. **Tool and Action Integration**  
   Explored how Agents interact with the external environment using tools. Learned to build and integrate actions into the agent loop and structured external interactions with LLMs.

3. **Hands-on Labs on Hugging Face Spaces**  
   Built and tested agents directly in Hugging Face Spaces using pre-configured environments.

4. **Use Case Application**  
   Applied agentic workflows to real-world scenarios like document understanding, search, and automation—demonstrating RAG and human-in-the-loop design.

5. **Final Quiz & Certification**  
   Earned the 🎓 **Certificate of Fundamentals of Agents** after completing the quiz and passing all course units.
